# The Perfect Guess
This is a simple number guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a number between 1 to 100. The program will provide hints to the user if the guessed number is greater or smaller than the actual number. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

The program also stores the highest score (lowest number of attempts) in a file called hiscore.txt. If the user beats the high score, the program will display a message saying so and update the high score in the file.

# Inputs
